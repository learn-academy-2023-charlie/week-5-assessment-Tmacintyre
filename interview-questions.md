# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a Ruby class?

Your answer: Calling super in a ruby class allows for the child class to inherit certain details from the parent class allowing us to not repeat certain code.

Researched answer: When we use the super in a ruby class, it allows you to invoke the parents class's details of a method from within a subclass. It allows you to use the parents methods with the same name and execute that within the subclass. 

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A ruby gem is basically a downloadable package that can give us access to librarys that other people have previously created to make things easier to future programmers. 

Researched answer: Ruby gems allow you to install and use other ruby packages on your computer. These are used to modify your ruby functionality. These are open sources and are available to help speed up the coding process.

3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: Relational databases orginize data into rows and columns such as excel. I am sure there are other types of databases.

Researched answer: In a relational database data is usually arranged and sorted through a set of primary and foreign keys which allows for easy access through queries and data retrieval. Types of databases include NoSQL databases, Object-Oriented databases, Time-series databases, and Graph Databases.

4. What are primary keys? Why purpose does a primary key serve?

Your answer: The primary key is a way to give a unique identifier to a set of data within a database allowing it to have easy access too while querying. 

Researched answer:These are used within a relational database as a unique identifier for a row in a table. this allows for uniqueness, data integrity, and organization making sure there is consistency of the data.  Also this is a major part of indexing. 


5. What are the five HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer: These would include Create, Read, Update, and Delete. I cannot this of a fifth. However each word relates exactly to its action word for word when it comes to coding.

Researched answer: The five HTTP verbs are Get, Post, Put, Delete, and Patch. Get is used to retrieve data, post is used to submit data, put is used to update or replace data, delete is obviously to delete data, and patch is usually used to update pre-existing data with new data. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Model validations refer to the process ensuring that certain data meets certain expectations or rules of the applications. 

2. RESTful routes: These routes map HTTP methods to their endpoint which is a URL allowing design and routes that follow the standardization of REST and allow interation with resources over HTTP. 

3. ERB: ERB is short hand for Embedded RuBy. This is a template allowing the implementation of ruby code within HTML, XML, and other text based documents. Similar to JSX allowing the combination of different languages. 

4. Params: These refer to a particular object that holds data sent in a request, similar to passing parameters as arguments. This is part of the ruby framework and is populated with request data from the HTTP. 

5. API: The Application Programming Interface. These are rules/protocols that allow software apps to interact together. Essential for enabling integration and building scalable software that provide a standard way for devs to access functionality.
